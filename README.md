# UdemySaver
UdemySaver is an open-source Udemy course downloader written in modern C++20. It lets you save videos, subtitles, and course assets you own for offline learning. 
A built-in HTTP server powers a responsive web interface so you can browse your Udemy library, queue downloads, and monitor progress from any browser.

## Features
- Download Udemy courses, lectures, subtitles, and attachments for offline access.
- Responsive web interface to browse your Udemy library.
- Queue and monitor downloads for single lectures or entire courses.
- Automatically organizes files under a structured `downloads/` directory.
- Cross-platform build via CMake for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# Requirements
| Tool/Library           | Notes                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| C++20 compiler         | MSVC / Clang / GCC        |
| CMake ≥ 3.8            | Build system              |
| Boost (system, thread, beast) | Networking primitives     |
| libcurl                | HTTP requests & downloads |
| nlohmann\_json         | JSON parsing              |
| FFmpeg                 | Video processing          |

## Build from source

### Windows
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jadis0x/UdemySaver.git
cd UdemySaver
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

### macOS
On macOS, use Homebrew to install dependencies:

```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install curl boost nlohmann-json ffmpeg cmake

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/jadis0x/UdemySaver.git
cd UdemySaver
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

The executable will be at `build/UdemySaver/UdemySaver`

## Configuration
Create a settings.ini alongside the executable:
```ini
# UdemySaver settings
udemy_access_token=PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
udemy_client_id=PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
udemy_api_base=https://www.udemy.com
http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888
download_subtitles=true
download_assets=true
```
You can also start the program without a token and paste it via the web interface; the file will be created automatically.

**Note:** Due to Cloudflare protection on Udemy's API, you need to use a proxy like mitmproxy to bypass bot detection. See the "Cloudflare Bypass" section below.

## Obtaining the access token and client_id

1. Log in to Udemy in your browser.
2. Open the developer tools (F12) and head to the Application/Storage tab.
3. Under **Cookies** for `www.udemy.com`:
   - Copy the **entire** value of `access_token` (including the colon `:` in the middle)
   - Copy the value of `client_id`
4. Use these values in `settings.ini` or paste the access token into the web UI when prompted.

**Important:** The `access_token` cookie has TWO parts separated by a colon (format: `public_key:private_key`). You must copy the complete value including both parts.

## Usage

1. Run the application:

```bash
./UdemySaver
```

2. Open a browser at <http://127.0.0.1:8080>.
3. If prompted, paste your Udemy access token.
4. Browse your library, choose a course, and click **Download**.
5. Files are saved under a `downloads/` directory.

## Cloudflare Bypass

Udemy uses Cloudflare protection to block automated API requests. To bypass this, you need to route UdemySaver through a local proxy like **mitmproxy**.

### Setup with mitmproxy

1. **Install mitmproxy:**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install mitmproxy

   # Linux
   pip install mitmproxy

   # Windows
   # Download from https://mitmproxy.org
   ```

2. **Start mitmproxy:**
   ```bash
   mitmproxy --listen-port 8888
   ```
   Keep this running in a separate terminal.

3. **Configure settings.ini:**
   Add the proxy setting to your `settings.ini`:
   ```ini
   http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888
   ```

4. **Run UdemySaver:**
   ```bash
   cd build/UdemySaver
   ./UdemySaver
   ```

5. **Access the web interface:**
   Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser.

The proxy will intercept and forward all requests, bypassing Cloudflare's bot detection. SSL certificate verification is automatically disabled when using a proxy.

### Why is this needed?

Udemy's Cloudflare protection uses:
- TLS fingerprinting to detect non-browser clients
- HTTP/2 fingerprinting
- Browser-specific headers (sec-ch-ua)

Routing through mitmproxy makes requests appear as if they're coming from a legitimate browser, allowing downloads to work.

## macOS-Specific Notes

This fork includes several enhancements for macOS compatibility:

### Changes Made
- **Platform-aware CMake configuration** - Automatically detects macOS and uses Homebrew dependencies
- **Custom FFmpeg finder module** - Locates FFmpeg libraries via pkg-config on macOS
- **Fixed Windows-only code** - Wrapped Windows-specific headers and macros in `#ifdef _WIN32`
- **Boost compatibility** - Updated to work with Homebrew's Boost 1.90+ (header-only mode)
- **Proxy SSL bypass** - Automatically disables SSL verification when using a proxy (required for mitmproxy)
- **Client ID support** - Added `udemy_client_id` configuration option
- **Browser fingerprinting headers** - Includes sec-ch-ua headers to help bypass Cloudflare

### Build Artifacts
After building, the executable is located at:
```
build/UdemySaver/UdemySaver
```

Run it from this directory to ensure `settings.ini` and the `www/` folder are properly located.
